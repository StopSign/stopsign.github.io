TODO NEXT:
	up the speed of game (debug only? exp/later upgrades will up the speed)
	Stop game from breaking when progress gain > progress req
	Hover methods
		Display row #
		Display progressReq
		Display progressSpeed
		Display current seconds of Bonus
		Display current total bonus modifier
		Display expCur / expTot, level
		Affects multiple rows at a time
		Color potency fades out, further from cursor
			Of all variables, too
	Display buttons
		EXP Visible - on/off for exp
		Progress Visible - on/off for progress (brings all rows to black)
	Graphics
		Improve buyButton look/feel
	EXP
		Each row has exp, levels
		Leveling up increases the amount of $ it gets
	Saving
		Try to make it as neat as possible
		It's a goddamn hassle, if I can avoid adding variables left and right i would prefer it.
	v2.0
		When it gets to level 20, it starts adding to a count every time it ticks (based on level) to an equivalent row on the next screen
			Arrows to move left and right
			Initial color hue is +120
			Same buttons, new resource / reset cost
			New progress still gets more difficult
			Extra row of buttons for additional upgrades unlocks for sending/receiving boost
				Improvements to 1st unlock for 1st page
					Or general improvements, 1 of which ups the usefulness of 1st
			"Some of the lost boost gets sent over" Like 20%
			On the second page, it sends boost downwards instead of up
				I have no idea what this would look like
			Each row has a level
				level increase speed % if going too slow
	v3.0
		Repeat it as a formula, expanding to the right and alternating sending boost up and down
			
			
		

Add Exp
	Levels affect boost growth formula

hover works on all nearby rows, not just current
	color of selection fades out


Variants:
Row completion temporarily improves speed of row above it
	New row costs
	Driver as a buff to the end
	Collector
	All rows are moving all the time
	
Row completion adds progress to the row above it, using a regular Driver
	Driver is the only one moving on it's on
	When driver moves too fast, it switches into bonus
	Alternate variant: Driver has build/expend states
	Add or remove progress bars at will
	
Row completion adds progress to the row above it, using a special Driver
	Build/expend states
	Upgrades focus solely on drivers and collectors
	
Row completion adds progress to the row above it, Resource gain only on Collector completion
	Each collector completion force adds a new row
	Upgrades are powerful because resources are rare.

Row completion adds to velocity of row above it
	Takes a lot of time to reach the collector to start
	Add or remove progress bars at will

Row completion adds speed to a random row

Row completion adds to velocity of one row above it, but subtracts speed from two rows above it.


Variations based on manual actions
	Mouse hover to boost speed/effect of selected row
		Affects multiple rows in proximity to the hovered
	When hovered row completes, gain a bonus
		Maximum micro required. Works best when patterns regularly form
			Catch the pattern would be hella fun
				Variant: this is the *only* way to gain resource

Variations based on two resources
	Alternating rows
		ABAB or AA1A12A123A1234 where numbers improve velocity and letters are speed.
	High-bonus bars horizontally 'split' into next resource
		
Row-specific buffs
	Removes generated patterns to give specific ones
	
5 choices of progress bar types to add (as the buttons), with each having a different effect (local powerful buff, global slow-as-hell perma buffs, collector, driver, ?)
