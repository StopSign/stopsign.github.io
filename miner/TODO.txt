TODOs:
Change the algorithms of Miner 3 & 4
Math the findMaterialInGrid method so it doesn't have a for loop
get rid of the isDead variable, everywhere. toughness/health<= 0 is the equivalent
rename 'plot' to 'stake' in the code, to match the UI name


Potential bug? I saw hitting no trees, while other trees exist, later get wood and the next tree starts being hit - invisible first tree?
