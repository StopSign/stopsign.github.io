    purpose
        Make combat more interesting and less one-dimensional
        build up over time
        can't be accessed immediately in the level - requires minimal propagation
unit statistics

image pooling for map
browsers
mobile


additional ideas -
    bestiary to show unit types
        simulate combat
    need more goals than "overcome next wall". Consider sprawling in a different direction?
        dungeons for king/heroes
        research technologies / magic
        alternate uses of soul crystals
        new power systems / damage types
        inner world growth
        apprentice

    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward

    complex movements

Questions -
    Better way to re-arrange Stats? Or Extras?
