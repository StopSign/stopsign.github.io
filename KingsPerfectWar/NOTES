bug - ensure all hideouts are dead before next level unlocks

handle units list targeting base that doesn't exist


level design
    tutorial improvements
        unable to click except
        highlight
        option to skip
    levels scale in time from ~1 minute to ~15 minutes over ~20 levels
    make a random level generator?
    1 time prizes of WIS/INT on *very* difficult dungeons every few levels, starting at 5
    increasing gold prizes and EXP for clearing each level to entice players to stay at peak
extras tab
    discord link
    polls



heroes
    purpose
        Make combat more interesting and less one-dimensional
        build up over time
        can't be accessed immediately in the level - requires minimal propagation
unit statistics

additional ideas -
    need more goals than "overcome next wall". Consider sprawling in a different direction?
        dungeons for king/heroes
        research technologies / magic
        alternate uses of soul crystals
        new power systems / damage types
        inner world growth
        apprentice

    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward

Questions -
    Better way to re-arrange Stats? Or Extras?
