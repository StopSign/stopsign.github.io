Developer Guide:

To create a new div element:
1. Create it in viewCreate
2. Where you create it, use queueCache(id)
3. In the relevant update method, use:
- views.updateVal(id, newVal, "style.color")
- views.updateVal(id, newVal?"":"none", "style.display")
- views.updateVal(id, newVal, "textContent", 1)
- views.updateVal(id, newVal, "textContent", "time")


to update/force refresh an action/upgrade:
1. increase data.saveVersion
2. set actionData[""].creationVersion to data.saveVersion

saving: update engine to separate the things that can be applied manually / on load - things like ability modifiers of actions

idea: numbers in the lines between that update based on the log of the resource being sent

-keep track of the total amount of atts gained, and the total amount of levels gained for actions too.
potentially use those as modifiers later (added up give bonuses?), which would make every game *really* unique but also
encourage resets so be careful when you do it. It could be as a conjoined gain play with unlocking a new cliff of souls



QoL that I just need to do:
QoL: if no downstream are visible, hide the all 0 / all 100 button
QoL: if the exp bar gets too fast, convert it into a completions/s window instead
Hide atts that aren't generated (stat window should be ??? until unlocked)
QoL: bar that raises/lowers based on =incoming / spending, to show you if it has reached equilibrium visually better

QoL I could monetize?: (200 per day)
QoL: 100 clicking the other actions in Downstream brings you to them, clicking ^ brings you to parent
QoL: 200 whenever your screen is jumped around, it saves the previous spot and you can go back to it with space/button "return"
QoL: 500 saves up to 10 in the queue to go back. Can custom set it
QoL: 500 Clicking the atts in the menu to highlight which actions
QoL: 500 Clicking the atts in the Stats menu to highlight them
QoL: 500 show atts on the side of actions (+, -, = but in graphic form)
QoL: 500 show momentum left to level under delta momentum
QoL: 500 show how much time that is also
QoL: [Req KTL] 1000 show how far you'll get in killing the lich's army
QoL: [Req KTL] 500 adds up your total souls and divides by time to show souls/hr, souls/day.
QoL: [Req KTL] 1000 on each action, at the end of Info, show Time to Unlock: XX (-5:30) with what's in the parenthesis being the difference in time to the previous reset
QoL: 200 Show on level up the total effect so far of that action (aka +1 Memory, +7 total = x1.8 bonus
QoL: 500 show minimap
QoL: 1000 Run Info - get a graph of how all the levels increased over time per action
QoL: Pie chart / explanation for source of atts


//5800 so far. I'll give ~1000 up front, ~2000 more over the next few days, ~10000 more over the next few weeks.

Performance: replacing display:"none" with opacity and checking

Thoughts:
The balance is shaping out to be good up to the first job, should I be trying to reset soon?
How do I both reset and *greatly* extend the game
Story-wise, it'd be finding the amulet way earlier.
-You learn about the lich and the army coming (rumors with Scott in socialize)
-You gain a button to switch your power's target to Kill the Lich
-Pressing this button takes your total momentum across all actions and brings you to a new page with all the momentum on one action
-Another action is "charge the time crystal", which is sapping an exponentially increasing amount (exp to level = 1, actionPowerIncrease = 1.05) of motivation from the primary action
-there is a single place to put it downstream, "kill enemies"
--Kill Enemies keeps progress between resets
--It gives currency every level, increasing per level gained
--kill enemies gives a bit of a boost at unlock, and that's all the first level should be able to do
--First go around gives you 1 level, then teh requirements are x1.05

Gameplay, this would:
-Reset every few hours
-Long saves would be fully kept still, as it would Kill Enemies
-After first reset, resetting is available immediately (with a minimum momentum of roughly what was required for the first), though of course you would want more momentum in the next reset
-Exponential momentum means that the amount of Kill could be much more than previous
--This is half-accounted for with the pricing of upgrades in the rebirth menu
--It is also half-accounted for with having like +10 Karma on unlock, which resets every time
--later, Kill More Enemies gives +100 Karma on unlock. Requires a certain level of Kill Enemies to see

Karma Unlock Upgrades:
Story Points cost 10 Karma, then a second for 10 Karma
Put a Story Points into "regions" on a map (basically chapters. Shows existing chapters, locked of course.)
You have 3 possible Coincidences, and you'll have to choose 2. The choice should be obvious though.
-In the future, region unlocks are given in a 2/3 ratio to the amount of coincidences you have to use them, roughly.
-Maybe unlock more in chunks instead though






add onUnlock messages and custom divs, and show +1 to remember level on unlock travel on road and travel to outpost

add coloring when level is maxed
add reveal graphic for new actions

display momentum visually:
underneath

play the game and tweak it
    -remember should have 3 increases to overclock's expertise before capping out - "this is expertise"
    -make money improves unrelated atts for now, but it starts spend money. Has low expertise also
    -spend money improves overclock's atts - not expertise

atts UI:
-Red when stat is used but not gained
-Green when stat is gained but not used
-Black when used & gained
-Select a stat to modify the borders of all actions that use it, colored how they use it


Tutorial toasts


figure out "total expertise mult" x1.00

When the numbers are below a certain threshold, make them 0

test the mana conversion - separate generator, mproved with atts

move ^ button to top right
Make money will use the highest $/s job as its base output in a desynced progress bar
-each Job action has a base $/s, and improves with the job levels

Create and see tags, for use in gaining expertise

Create the ability for an action to have charges, gained per exp spend

color the atts based on blue for creating without using, red for using without sending - only reveal if colored.


Spells have an initial mana cost very high, and leveling them *reduces* the amount of exp needed to cast
Casting them still gives exp that is multipled by atts as normal
This lets mana increase linearly and still feel good over time

test 2-1-2 patterns
test stat bonus rate/s

atts should show how many actions they affect

tag system: 1st pass to apply tags, 2nd pass to apply mults


prestige idea: per action, it can be upgraded to reduece the tier all the way to 0, with each tier and upgrade taking more points.
Can be used to drastically improve the generators output


COMBAT NEEDS TO BE SIMPLER THAN THIS:
Combat brainstorming:
* Has to use magic for damage
* Has to use health and defense - take hits
* Combat is every 5 minutes
* Only 1 combat can happen at a time
* Combat takes ~30 seconds
* Spells have a maximum charge
* They still consume mana and gain exp after that maximum charge is reached
* They can be set to "dump" for exp
* Spell charges can be used for non-combat things like healing people or detecting traps/magic
* It uses 1 spell per exp gain, or else the exp gain stops

Combat info:
* Enemies come at you in front
* Magic is casted all the time, from your biggest spells down
* Magic is used to buildup spells

Tournament/dungeon/combat actions:
* Momentum builds tokens (filling the momentum bar).
* Each action has multiple layers of fights you can spend tokens on.
* Tokens can be automatically spent, but have a cooldown (30 seconds)
* Action can be set to try the highest ranked, until failure
* When the fight begins, you use your spells in spell order
* You have 1 spell cast per school of magic (abjuration, evocation, illusion, etc.) on separate timers
(defense, damage, support)
* Spell order can be set/customized in separate lists
* In parallel, you use a ranged attack if no enemies in melee range
* You use a melee attack if enemies are in range
* Defensive spells are used as needed, optimally (shield, heal, cure)
* Enemies all spawn at once and come at you
* Kill them all without dying
* Can set where allies/summons are located, for who gets hit first (1,2,3 pyramid)


Requires:
* Lots of coding/testing for this
* Heal/Cure/Illusion spells
-NOT found in academy, which only has dps and shields
-Healers have healing, disease story gives you cure, thieves give you illusion



In the story:
Flesh out the adventures
Flesh out some characters
Write out what you have for brainstorming the ending


On Magic:
* All mana is Raw, Elemental, or Pure.
* Elements
** Fire - Damage spells
** Earth - Protection spells
** Water - Healing spells
** Arcane - Illusion/movement spells
* Pure is for divination/detection/story/rituals


Combat:
* With enough momentum in a combat action, it initiates the fight using your spell charges.
* There will be a timer/progress bar that will use fire charges to attack
* In parallel, there will be a timer/progress bar that will use Arcane charges to disable the enemy
* In parallel, there will be a timer/progress bar that will use Earth charges to create shields
* In parallel, there will be a timer/progress bar that will use weapons to attack




story:
A curse kept the level cap low
Garret was a soldier, used his Overclock to be strong and wealthy,
which led him to being a soldier
But monsters invaded, and
His city burned, and
he used Overclock to Get Out, to somewhere peaceful.
He joined one of the refugee caravans, and then kept going until his power said to stop
He struggles at first with survival's guilt, but he bottles it up for survival
He's joins a village
The curse was just lifted





reshape the actions
the unveling of the resources should be more *grand*
first few actions have max level and give huge buffs
overall, give atts at 50 and 100 at a time, aiming for thousands



big resources later:
Arcana
Fortune
Intrigue/Rumors



later: challenges are the lich sending enemy time travelers into your timeline to interfere, and it blocks off certain important paths in the challenge. Another way to do it is to start with heavy negative atts in certain areas, which effectively blocks them off.




everyone gets a talent, and yours is "with sufficient momentum, there are no barriers" and eventually you realize you want more motivation


you're prepared for a future that's not happening, because the world started ending - monsters are appearing in portals all over the country
your parents died a couple of years ago and you've been in a funk since. You have money and education, but minimal connections.
You've been desperate for purpose, and you've decided fighting monsters is your calling.
You also just read a book where the character helped himself by helping others.
The country is collapsing, but your lands are self-sufficient and unaffected... for now.

--This is the spine of the story, but it means a lot can change.
For example, the world can be medieval, steam punk, or modern. The monsters can be demons, an invasion, aliens, etc.

later

...

It wasn't enough. You were missing something crucial: being wrong. Having counselors and professionals to tell you how to *think*, not just what they can offer.

You have time now, though, thanks to your parent's artifact.

======

stop being mired to overclock / spend money / socialization / mana
it can be a different starting point, or a different alternate

1st attempt: on your own, with your own knowledge - money, self-improvement
2nd attempt: gaining knowledge (+mana) to go on
3rd attempt:


experiment with design patterns
anime|pixar etc.



actions, radial:
East - Advance in the story
West - Enhance the ability to advance
South - personal
North - social




actions need to be "carved" into memory, having a very very low rate of expertise to start, which affects their ability to use momentum
actions have 0-100% expertise, and start at an amount related to how much the character would know about them. Raising expertise is *hard*.
Expertise is efficiency - it will waste momentum and not consume it for progress or sending - only 100% expertise will be "no" waste

Actions have tags, and some some rewards are to increase all actions of a certain tagged type





expertise doesn't get better by default when you reset - many completions will help the efficiency.
Personal will account for roughly ~30% of expertise gain (more in the beginning), and social 70% in the ideal (ramping up over time)
Expertise works by adding to a new var Object.skill. Expertise changes the efficency to =


Change to 1% overclock cimb, adding +.1 each reset up to 2%
Chagne starting momentum gain to 1
keep tier 0 for a bit, because efficiency is gonna be baad
req: 1st action improves overclock, 2nd action improves 1st, 3rd unlocks 4th which improves 2nd, etc. - grow fast and hard at the start


Visualize Victory
Remember the fallen <- Honor Past Sacrifices / Pay Tribute to Heroes <- Commemorate Heroes <- Light a Beacon (req: masterwork art?)
Reaffirm your vows <- Practice Devotion <- Worship <- Divine Communion


vice, which increases its own stat and decreases the other's atts





The actions are things that could feasibly be done in parallel - AKA 1 "work" action
- This could actually be an entire sub-menu w/ folders:
Work:
-low wage job
-no wage job
-mid wage job
-high wage job
Story (one time actions), unlocks more mental actions, simple progress bar that gets reduced based on atts:
-training montage
-traveling
   -disables jobs and therefore socials

^^^I can do all this in current system


The actions improve the jobs, but only a little.
Jobs change which people are available to talk to at one time
